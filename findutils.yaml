Description: |
    The findutils package contains programs which will help you locate
    files on your system.  The find utility searches through a hierarchy
    of directories looking for files which match a certain set of criteria
    (such as a filename pattern).  The xargs utility builds and executes
    command lines from standard input arguments (usually lists of file
    names generated by the find command).
    
    You should install findutils because it includes tools that are very
    useful for finding things on your system.
